      # User asked for "Prometheus scrape config". 
      # For batch jobs, Pushgateway is standard, but keeping it simple:
      # We will use the Pushgateway pattern OR just expect the Python process to not be scraped directly?
      # "Exposes Prometheus metrics for validation outcomes and latency."
      # Batch processes die, so scrape is hard without Pushgateway.
      # However, for simplicity, we might just use Pushgateway or keep it extremely simple.
      # Let's add a placeholder target for now, maybe we run a metrics server.
